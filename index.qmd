## About this book {.unnumbered .unlisted}

The two renowned investment advisors and authors of the bestseller *The Great Reckoning* examine both catastrophic influences and the potential for prosperity and renewal in light of radical changes in human history. The Sovereign Individual outlines strategies necessary to financially prepare for the next phase of Western civilization.

Few observers of the late twentieth century had their fingers so presciently on the pulse of the global political and economic reorganization that ushered in the new millennium as James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg. Their bold prediction of a Wall Street catastrophe in Blood in the Streets was confirmed on Black Tuesday. In their subsequent bestseller The Great Reckoning, published just weeks before the coup attempt against Gorbachev, they analyzed the impending collapse of the Soviet Union and predicted the civil war in Yugoslavia and other events that proved to be some of the most shocking developments of recent years.

In The Sovereign Individual, Davidson and Rees-Mogg explore the greatest economic and political transformation in centuries - the transition from an industrial to an information society. This transition, which they describe as "the fourth stage of human society," will liberate the individual as never before and irrevocably change the power of governments. This outstanding book will replace false hopes and fictions with new understanding and enlightened values.
